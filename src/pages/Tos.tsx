        Cheap, fast solutions to squad building challenges using players in your club.

        Are you tired of spending time on solving squad building challenges (SBCs) in FIFA ultimate team? Maybe you prefer using players which you already own, but it takes ages to find a cheap solution?  Then you have come to the right place! We've developed an artificial intelligence which searches for a cheap solution to an SBC with the players in your club!
      </p>
      <p className="text-secondary text-m text-left">
        Our service is still at an early stage and we are currently working hard on improving the AI. We are also working on some different extensions - for example searching for solutions where we use a few cheap players from the transfer market, in case no solutions exist within your club.
      </p>
      <p className="text-secondary text-m text-left">
        Note that when we load the players in your club, we NEVER interact with the web-app. We only read the player names in order to tailor solutions to your club!
      </p>
